# Smorrery WebApp - Gaia Room

## Project Inroduction
This project presents an interactive 3D solar system environment built with real-time celestial body calculations, using NASA's orbital data to dynamically update the positions and paths of planets, asteroids, and comets. The system offers accurate simulations of the solar system's celestial objects, and provides users with multiple interactive and educational modules.

## Project Purpose

This application offers an interactive 3D environment that simulates planetary, asteroid, and comet movements using NASA data. Users can customize displays, interact with models via mouse, adjust time and speed, and track celestial objects in real-time.

The system is divided into five key modules:
1. **Education Module:** Provides 3D visualizations for teaching astronomy concepts like Kepler's laws, enabling real-time classroom interaction.
2. **Event Module:** Displays a timeline of near-Earth objects, showing past and potential future threats, with detailed orbital data.
3. **Lab Module:** Allows users to create and simulate asteroid movements by adjusting parameters like mass and velocity to explore orbital dynamics.
4. **Challenge Module:** Uses AI to generate interactive quizzes based on solar system knowledge, tracking user performance for educational insights.
5. **Tour Module:** Enables virtual space exploration, allowing users to observe planetary surfaces and famous celestial landmarks like Mars' Valles Marineris. This application offers an engaging platform for educational and exploratory purposes, appealing to students, educators, and space enthusiasts.
