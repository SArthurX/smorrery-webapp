  <div>
    A line joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas during equal
    intervals of time.

    The orbital radius and angular velocity of the planet in the elliptical
    orbit will vary. This is shown in the animation: the planet travels faster
    when closer to the Sun, then slower when farther from the Sun. Kepler's
    second law states that the blue sector has constant area.
